# Summary
LinkRippr is a static analysis tool for HTML files. You can search a HTML file for artifacts of interest by specifying element tags and attribute names, or RegExp to search for signatures in `<script>` and `<style>` blocks. LinkRippr will then output a simple summary of any artifacts of interest, as identified by you, that were detected in the document.

The original purpose of LinkRippr was to be used by cyber security analysts during investigations that involve HTML files, such as credential harvesting websites or phishing email attachments. Due to it's flexibility, however, there likely exists use cases that I have not envisioned.

While LinkRippr is limited in many respects when compared with more robust dynamic analysis solutions, it can serve as a first step in the analysis process by quickly identifying those files that require closer examination due to the presence of suspicious artifacts.  As the analyst becomes aware of new methods used by malicious actors, they can create signatures that detect them.

### Installation
LinkRippr does not require any installation. Simply download the ZIP archive from the [main repository page](https://github.com/sjb-ch1mp/LinkRippr) and extract it onto your local workstation. LinkRippr can then be launched by opening the LinkRippr.html file in a web browser.

# User Guide
### Submitting a HTML file
HTML files can be submitted to LinkRippr by uploading the file in the _SETTINGS_ panel, under `< Analyze />`, or can be dragged and dropped into the browser. When submitting a HTML document using the drag-and-drop method, however, you must ensure that LinkRippr has detected the file prior to dropping it so that it doesn't render. LinkRippr will inform you that it is ready to receive the sample by announcing in the top panel (the **chatter box**) the following: 
> File detected. Bombs away!

### User Options
User options are located in the _SETTINGS_ panel under `< Options />`. There currently exists four options that can be toggled on or off.
|Option|Description|Default Setting|
|-------|-----------|--------------|
|Truncate Output|Any lines in the summary that are greater than 100 characters long will be truncated to 97 characters plus '...'. This option simply makes the output more readable.|&#9745;|
|Attempt Simple Deobfuscation|LinkRippr will attempt to deobfuscate simple JavaScript methods that are commonly used to hide malicious content in a HTML file.|&#9745;|
|Extract Conditional HTML|LinkRippr will check comments, denoted in HTML by the tag `<!`, for [conditional comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment), and include any that are detected (and are not empty) in the summary.|&#9745;|
|Debug Mode|This mode will dump all the tokens generated by the [DOM Parser](https://github.com/sjb-ch1mp/LinkRippr/blob/master/js/dom_parser.js) to the summary panel. This option is used to debug the tokenizer and parser.|&#9744;|

### Saving and Loading Settings
You can save your current settings, including all HTML, JavaScript and CSS signatures into a text file. This can then be loaded the next time the you launch LinkRippr so that you don't need to manually enter each signature. This feature is located in the _SETTINGS_ panel under `< Save />`.
